Smart contract on Solidity to store and retrieve data (supposedly encrypted beforehand) and key to decrypt this data from blockchain.
The key can be provided only specified time after the data had been stored. Strictly after that the retrieve function starts to work, retrieving the data and the key.
Data providing and key providing is only available to the contract owner. Retrieving is available for everybody.
